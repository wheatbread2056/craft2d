# craft2D
Craft2D is a game where there are blocks, a world, and large (not infinite) possibilities.

# How to Play
There is currently one instance, at https://wheatbread2056.github.io/craft2d

It should always be updated to the latest commit, although that does mean that some versions may be unfinished or unstable.

You can also download the latest release, if there is one. If not, just clone the repository and open index.html in a browser.

## How to install Custom Scripts
(Warning) Custom scripts execute code that is not present in the main game, only use scripts that you trust!

---

First, download the custom script, wherever it may be from, and be cautious to not download a malicious script.

Next, go into your game folder (the one with index.html) and make a scripts folder. Call it whatever you like, and put the script in there.

Now, make a scripts.js file in the game folder. Then, load the script, for example if you wanted to load mods/example.js, scripts.js would be:

```js
loadScript('mods/example.js');
```

The final step is to simply reload the game, and the scripts should load! If not, look in the developer console (ctrl+shift+i or F12) and troubleshoot the error.

## Why play craft2D?
You don't have a reason to play craft2D.

## What is craft2D written in?
Craft2D is written in raw JavaScript, and does not use an engine or library made for games.

## Why are there no versions before alpha 1.7 available?
Before alpha 1.7, I was not using GitHub with this project as I believed it would go nowhere.
