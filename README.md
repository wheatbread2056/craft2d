# craft2D
Craft2D is a game where there are blocks, a world, and large (not infinite) possibilities.

# How to Play
There is currently one instance, at https://wheatbread2056.github.io/craft2d

It should always be updated to the latest commit, although that does mean that some versions may be unfinished or unstable.

You can also download the latest release, if there is one. If not, just clone the repository and open index.html in a browser.

## Why play craft2D?
You don't have a reason to play craft2D.

## What is craft2D written in?
Craft2D is written in raw JavaScript, and does not use an engine or library made for games.

## Why are there no versions before alpha 1.7 available?
Before alpha 1.7, I was not using GitHub with this project as I believed it would go nowhere.
